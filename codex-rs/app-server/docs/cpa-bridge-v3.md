# CPA / Codex master protocol v3

Contract identifier: **V3-SEP-20260927**. This document supersedes the earlier
chat alternatives concerning body notifications.

Current upstream: official `openai/codex` default branch `main`, commit
`afb436df8b70bb5bc57b86d9a3e829968988cd21`, fetched on 2026-10-04 at
20:42:10 +08:00. This is a default-branch source merge, not a release-tag rebase.
The CPA v3 envelope and dedicated image tag remain unchanged; normalization rules
for this branch are specified below.

## Identity and state

`credentialId` is CPA's existing file-backed `Auth.ID`: the case-sensitive path
relative to the shared auth directory on Linux. There is no separate worker ID,
account ID, credential filename setting, or owner field in the bridge contract.
The master uses that same ID for its per-credential process map and private state
directory: `CODEX_HOME/<credentialId>/`. Original names, extensions, spaces and
nested directories are preserved. For example, with the default state root,
`team/account.json` uses `/var/lib/codex/team/account.json/`. When that readable
directory is absent, an existing legacy hash directory is moved there before the
worker starts. If both exist, the readable directory takes precedence and the
legacy directory is left untouched.

The shared file has `codex_cli: {enabled: true|false}`. Only a Codex file with
`enabled: true` and without top-level `disabled: true` runs an account process.
Original file names and locations remain unchanged. A worker has a private,
persistent CODEX_HOME and reads/writes the shared original credential file.

## Connection and control

The default endpoint is `ws://127.0.0.1:38317/cpa/v1/ws`. No bridge key or
Authorization header is required. `initialize` / `initialized` remain.

`cpa/capabilities/read {}` and `cpa/credential/reload {credentialId?: string}`
return master capabilities:

```json
{"protocolVersion":3,"runtimeVersion":"...","upstreamRevision":"...","executionMode":"inference-only","operations":["responses"],"rawBody":true,"responseIdentityMapping":true,"manualOAuth":true,"upstreamLogs":true,"upstreamBodyLogs":true}
```

Reload scans one credential or the directory and waits for the corresponding
processes to start/stop. It does not change credential control fields. CPA owns
selection and effective flags; the master only applies them.

## Inference

`cpa/inference/start` takes
`{requestId, credentialId, operation, sourceFormat, sessionId, request}` and returns
`{requestId, statusCode, headers}`. There is no `accountId` parameter. The worker
maps the semantic request into the native Codex request builder, sends once
through the native auth/provider transport, and does not start an agent/tool loop.

Ordered notifications:

- `cpa/inference/upstream`: existing `request`, `response`, and `error` log
  notifications with `requestId`, actual URL/method/headers/body/status/message.
  Header values are string arrays. Actual token SHA256 and gateway node remain
  optional logging metadata.
- **`cpa/inference/body {requestId, bodyBase64}`**: HTTP response bytes after the
  selective identity projection described below.
  This is the only business-response body channel. Do not emit an additional
  `upstream kind:"body"` or parsed `cpa/inference/event` copy.
- `cpa/inference/completed {requestId}`: normal HTTP body EOF.
- `cpa/inference/error {requestId, httpStatus, message, body?, headers?}`: a failed
  transfer; do not follow it with a successful completion.

Send the start result before pulling/transferring body bytes. Request/response
log entries may precede acceptance. CPA receives the business-response byte stream
and applies its normal SSE/response processing. The bridge examines only supported
identity paths; function-call contents remain opaque.
Concurrent requests for one credential must remain supported.

Source `session_id`, `thread_id`, `turn_id`, `prompt_cache_key`, `parent_turn_id`
and `root_turn_id`, plus `parent_thread_id`, `thread_source`, `subagent_kind`,
`x-openai-subagent`, `agent_name`, `window_id` and `request_kind`, are read from
top-level request fields, then flat
`client_metadata`, then its JSON-encoded `x-codex-turn-metadata` (in that order).
`x-codex-parent-thread-id` and `x-codex-window-id` are accepted aliases. Identity
values are limited to 4096 bytes each and cannot contain control characters.

The credential and outer CPA `sessionId` form an isolation namespace. Within it,
the source session identifies the root (falling back to the source thread, then
the RPC scope if both are absent). A deterministic UUID identifies that native
session. A missing thread or a thread equal to the source session uses the root
UUID; a distinct thread maps to its own UUID within that root. Parent references
use the same mapping, including grandchildren. `session-id` carries the root and
`thread-id` carries the current thread. The body cache key uses the root UUID;
the source cache key does not independently identify a conversation. Explicit
subagent metadata is preserved/rebuilt, including the native `collab_spawn`
compatibility header for `subagent_kind: "thread_spawn"`. Unequal session/thread
IDs alone do not classify a request as a subagent. Source turn and root/parent
turn IDs survive. Authentication and installation identities remain worker-owned.

This is logical mapping only: no ThreadManager thread, rollout, conversation
history or local tool/agent loop is created. The process model stays one worker
per enabled credential, with multiple isolated session/thread contexts inside it;
there is no operating-system process per source session. Different credentials
or outer CPA scopes do not automatically share a session or routing state.

When a source turn ID is missing, the worker generates a UUIDv7 on the first
request and reuses it and its native routing context for exactly one hour from
creation, within the same root, thread, provenance and RPC scope. Requests do not
extend that window. After expiry, new requests receive a new turn ID and empty routing state;
in-flight requests retain their old context. Explicit source turn IDs are separate
from synthetic turns and their contexts expire after one hour without access.
This one-hour fallback groups requests for compatibility; it does not infer real
user-turn boundaries. Parent/source/subagent provenance and parent/root turn IDs
are part of the context key, preventing stale ancestry from being reused. Contexts
retain identities and native routing state, not message history, and reset on
worker restart. Requests must supply their own history.

Title inference is recognized only by `thread_source: "thread_title"` or
`request_kind: "thread_title"` / `"title_generation"`. These calls associate with
the same logical IDs but get disposable contexts outside the turn cache, with no
previous turn state. Missing turn IDs are fresh for each title call. They neither
create another local conversation nor trigger another title-generation request.
Prompt wording alone is not a title marker.

The cache holds at most 1024 contexts per worker. Expired entries are removed on
access. At capacity, new contexts receive HTTP 429; existing unexpired contexts
are never evicted to silently discard their routing state. Same-key creation is
atomic under the worker's short-lived mutex. The first valid upstream
`x-codex-turn-state` from HTTP headers or native `response.metadata` is retained.
No function call is executed.

## Response identity projection

`rawBody: true` identifies the existing `bodyBase64` byte-stream transport, not a
promise that every upstream byte is unchanged. The additive
`responseIdentityMapping: true` capability announces selective inverse mapping;
protocol version 3 and `inference-only` mode remain unchanged.

Each request has its own source/native mapping. Known session/thread/parent-thread,
cache, window and turn/root-turn/parent-turn fields are restored only when their
value exactly matches that request's mapped native value. Supported locations are
the root envelope, nested `response` / `error` envelopes, their `client_metadata`
and `headers`, and encoded `x-codex-turn-metadata`. Snake/camel spellings and the
native identity header aliases are recognized. If the corresponding source field
was absent, a matching generated field is removed instead of exposing a synthetic
source identity. Server-owned values that do not match the mapping remain intact.

Successful response headers allowlist `session-id`, `thread-id`,
`x-codex-parent-thread-id`, `x-codex-window-id` and `x-codex-turn-metadata` in
addition to the existing public diagnostic headers. Structured HTTP error bodies
and headers receive the same projection; stale body validators are removed when
an error body changes. The separate `cpa/inference/upstream` diagnostic channel
retains actual native request/response identities for troubleshooting.

This is not global string replacement: `response.id`, output/item IDs, `call_id`,
tool arguments/results, model text, generic business `metadata`, `x-request-id`
and opaque `turn_state` are untouched. Only what CPA actually passed to Codex can
be restored; values already replaced inside CPA cannot be recovered here.

SSE frames are buffered until their data can be examined. Unchanged events retain
their exact bytes, while modified JSON data is reserialized with non-data lines
preserved. Leading heartbeat/comment/event/id lines are forwarded immediately.
JSON HTTP responses are projected at EOF. Each pending SSE event or JSON response
input buffer is limited to 16 MiB; exceeding it fails the stream. Output IPC chunks
are at most 64 KiB. These transient buffers are not persisted conversation storage.

## OAuth

- `cpa/auth/login/start {credentialId}` -> `{loginId, authUrl, state}`.
- `cpa/auth/login/callback {loginId, redirectUrl}` -> `{status,error?}`.
- `cpa/auth/login/status {loginId}` -> `{status,error?}`.

The master remembers the login-to-credential association internally. CPA creates
a new UUID-named Codex placeholder file only for an explicitly requested new
authorization; reauthorization always uses the existing ID and original file.
There is no separate independently refreshed auth.json copy.

## Native request mapping

The child uses the retained native model catalog, `ModelClient` prompt/request
builder, and request options. Tool parsing has one owner in the core CPA adapter;
the IPC envelope validator does not maintain a second tool-type allowlist.
Supported tools are native `function`, `custom`, `namespace` (function/custom
children), and `web_search`. Search runs upstream, not in the worker. The parser
preserves namespace/name/description, grammar, supported JSON Schema constraints
including `encrypted`, `strict`, `defer_loading`, and explicit search booleans and
content types. Chat-style nested function definitions and `input_schema` tool
definitions are normalized without renaming tools. Unsupported fields/schema
constraints fail with a path such as `tools[3].tools[1]`, rather than being silently
removed. Function `output_schema` is not a supported wire field and is rejected.

Both ordinary Responses and Responses Lite serialize native `ToolSpec` values.
Lite uses the native `additional_tools` prefix and namespace convention; no raw
caller tools array overwrites the builder's output. Tool choice objects retain
their namespace semantics. Historical namespaces, call IDs, arguments and results
are preserved. There is no local tool router or agent loop. Response identity
projection does not rename tools or translate call IDs.

Current date and timezone are read from the worker's actual system clock and
runtime timezone configuration, with no country or language based default. An
unavailable IANA zone name is represented using the actual UTC offset. Only
standalone current `environment_context` / `codex_apps_client_time_context` text
blocks after the last assistant message or non-message history item are rewritten;
earlier history, quoted
examples, code fences, paths and OS declarations remain unchanged. A missing
current block is supplied as a small standalone message. Flat caller metadata
date/timezone fields are updated consistently; top-level date/timezone parameters
are consumed instead of being sent as unknown Responses parameters.

Field handling:

| Fields | Policy |
| --- | --- |
| model/input/instructions/tools/reasoning/service_tier | Parse and build using native types; normalize text messages and supported tool envelopes. |
| session/thread/cache/turn identities | Resolve once using the identity and lifecycle rules above. |
| headers/authorization/cookies and reserved device metadata | Worker-owned; caller values cannot override the transport. |
| tool_choice/text/include and unknown top-level extensions | Retain as documented request options, subject to tool-choice validation; extensions are not a guarantee of upstream support. |
| non-reserved flat client_metadata | Retain unless managed above. |
| previous_response_id/conversation/generate/store=true/background=true | Reject; stream=true is required. |
| response HTTP body | Restore matching known envelope identity fields, then forward as ordered base64 chunks; preserve opaque content. |

The `sourceFormat` label does not convert whole Chat/Claude conversations into
Responses. CPA still supplies the Responses request envelope and history.

HTTP authentication recovery can refresh credentials and retry a rejected 401;
accepted HTTP streams are never replayed. Body EOF is transport completion, not
an interpretation of any SSE event. All account activity ends when the master
has reaped the disabled child's process. Previously transmitted upstream work
cannot be recalled. The private state directory persists for reenable.

## Historical item IDs

Historical item IDs with a wrong type prefix are corrected using the native
item prefix and original suffix. Valid IDs, `call_id`, tool inputs and output
associations remain unchanged.

## Worker diagnostics

Default-visible JSONL stderr events include `cpa.worker.started` with credential
name, PID, CODEX_HOME and config path; `cpa.request.start`, `.mapping`, `.upstream`,
`.completed` and `.error` with `credentialId` and `rpcRequestId`. No `RUST_LOG`
setting is required. Validation failures and master dispatch errors are logged.
Mapping events distinguish source IDs, native metadata IDs, transport affinity,
cache key and actual turn state. Upstream events include status, redacted headers
and structured failure code/type/message. Authorization and cookies stay masked;
full request/response payloads continue through the existing CPA notifications.

`rpcRequestId` is the RPC UUID, not CPA's eight-character external log ID.
Use the actual upstream `x-request-id`, also present in CPA's detailed request
log, to correlate the two. stdout remains exclusively the JSON-RPC channel.

## Running outside the image

Set `CODEX_CPA_AUTH_DIR` to an existing shared directory and `CODEX_HOME` to the
private state root, then run `codex-app-server`. `CODEX_CPA_PORT` optionally changes
the default loopback port 38317. Only the master sets the child-only credential
path and ID environment variables; deployment never specifies a credential file.
