# CPA / Codex master protocol v3

Contract identifier: **V3-SEP-20260927**. This document supersedes the earlier
chat alternatives concerning body notifications.

## Identity and state

`credentialId` is CPA's existing file-backed `Auth.ID`: the case-sensitive path
relative to the shared auth directory on Linux. There is no separate worker ID,
account ID, credential filename setting, or owner field in the bridge contract.
The master uses that same ID for its per-credential process map. Private state
directories may encode/hash it internally without creating another public ID.

The shared file has `codex_cli: {enabled: true|false}`. Only a Codex file with
`enabled: true` and without top-level `disabled: true` runs an account process.
Original file names and locations remain unchanged. A worker has a private,
persistent CODEX_HOME and reads/writes the shared original credential file.

## Connection and control

The default endpoint is `ws://127.0.0.1:38317/cpa/v1/ws`. No bridge key or
Authorization header is required. `initialize` / `initialized` remain.

`cpa/capabilities/read {}` and `cpa/credential/reload {credentialId?: string}`
return master capabilities:

```json
{"protocolVersion":3,"runtimeVersion":"...","upstreamRevision":"...","executionMode":"inference-only","operations":["responses"],"rawBody":true,"manualOAuth":true,"upstreamLogs":true,"upstreamBodyLogs":true}
```

Reload scans one credential or the directory and waits for the corresponding
processes to start/stop. It does not change credential control fields. CPA owns
selection and effective flags; the master only applies them.

## Inference

`cpa/inference/start` takes
`{requestId, credentialId, operation, sourceFormat, sessionId, request}` and returns
`{requestId, statusCode, headers}`. There is no `accountId` parameter. The worker
maps the semantic request into the native Codex request builder, sends once
through the native auth/provider transport, and does not start an agent/tool loop.

Ordered notifications:

- `cpa/inference/upstream`: existing `request`, `response`, and `error` log
  notifications with `requestId`, actual URL/method/headers/body/status/message.
  Header values are string arrays. Actual token SHA256 and gateway node remain
  optional logging metadata.
- **`cpa/inference/body {requestId, bodyBase64}`**: original HTTP response bytes.
  This is the only business-response body channel. Do not emit an additional
  `upstream kind:"body"` or parsed `cpa/inference/event` copy.
- `cpa/inference/completed {requestId}`: normal HTTP body EOF.
- `cpa/inference/error {requestId, httpStatus, message, body?, headers?}`: a failed
  transfer; do not follow it with a successful completion.

Send the start result before pulling/transferring body bytes. Request/response
log entries may precede acceptance. CPA logs the raw bytes and applies its normal
SSE/response processing. The master/worker do not parse function-call responses.
Concurrent requests for one credential must remain supported.

## OAuth

- `cpa/auth/login/start {credentialId}` -> `{loginId, authUrl, state}`.
- `cpa/auth/login/callback {loginId, redirectUrl}` -> `{status,error?}`.
- `cpa/auth/login/status {loginId}` -> `{status,error?}`.

The master remembers the login-to-credential association internally. CPA creates
a new UUID-named Codex placeholder file only for an explicitly requested new
authorization; reauthorization always uses the existing ID and original file.
There is no separate independently refreshed auth.json copy.

## Native request mapping

The child uses the retained native model catalog and `ModelClient` prompt/request
builder and request options. It normalizes text input into native message items,
uses caller instructions and function/custom tool definitions, model-dependent
Responses Lite layout, reasoning, output schema and native metadata/headers.
Caller tool-choice objects and additional top-level Responses options are retained
explicitly after native construction. Unsupported native input/tool schemas fail
with HTTP 400 instead of silently dropping constraints. Caller transport identity
headers, persistent session IDs, background generation and server-executed tools
remain unavailable. No agent turn or tool router is created for inference.

HTTP authentication recovery can refresh credentials and retry a rejected 401;
accepted HTTP streams are never replayed. Body EOF is transport completion, not
an interpretation of any SSE event. All account activity ends when the master
has reaped the disabled child's process. Previously transmitted upstream work
cannot be recalled. The private state directory persists for reenable.

## Running outside the image

Set `CODEX_CPA_AUTH_DIR` to an existing shared directory and `CODEX_HOME` to the
private state root, then run `codex-app-server`. `CODEX_CPA_PORT` optionally changes
the default loopback port 38317. Only the master sets the child-only credential
path and ID environment variables; deployment never specifies a credential file.
